# StructrualDynamics603 <br>

## Introduction
* This reposotory is created for the graduate level course CIVE603 Structural Dynamics in McGill University.<br><br>

### Assignment2
* In this assignment, the Rd value versus t0/T is plotted in both the free vibration and force vibration.

### Assignment3
* In Problem A in this assignment, the seismic response of single free structure is simulated by Central Difference Method, and the difference between the analytical and numerical simulation is compared.
* In the simulation, the seismic record is EI Centro Ground Motion and Canoga Park record.

### Assignment4
* The response of inelastic SDF system to earthquake motion is investigated with elastic and inelatic strength demand.
* The force-deformaiton relation is plotted with different ductility reduction factor.
* The constant ductility abosolute acceleration spectrum is also plotted with different ductility reduction factor.

### Assignment5
* This assignment focuses on the Multi-Degree Freedom systems
* The natural frequency of mode, mode are calculated. And the orthogonality is verified.
* The modal property, such as Modal Mass, Modal Stiffness and Modal Damping are calculated.

### Assignment6
* In the part A, each mode is regarded as a SDF. And the seismic response is simulated.
* The SAP2000 is used to invstiagted the structure's preformance with laminated-rubber.
